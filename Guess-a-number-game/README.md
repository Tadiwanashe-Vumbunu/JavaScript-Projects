# Guess A Number

This project is called **Guess A Number**. It aims to equip learners with **DOM manipulation in JavaScript**. The game features a retro design inspired by 80s games.

## How the Game Works

The goal is to guess a **secret number between 1 and 100**.

- The player enters a number and clicks the **Check** button.
- A message indicates whether the guess is:
  - 📉 Too low  
  - 📈 Too high  
  - ✅ Correct  

## Scoring System

- The score starts at **10**.
- Each incorrect guess reduces the score by **1**.
- When the guess is correct:
  - A congratulatory message is displayed  
  - The screen turns green  
  - The high score is updated  

- Clicking the **Again** button:
  - Resets the game  
  - Keeps the high score  
  - Allows players to beat their previous best  

## Improvements I made apart from the Original Version

### When the Guess is Correct
1. The main text changes from **"Guess My Number"** to **"You Win"**  
2. The **Check** button disappears to prevent further clicks by the user

### When the Player Loses
3. The high score resets to **0**  
4. The background turns **red**  
5. The main text changes to **"Game Over!"**  

### Other Changes
6. The range is now **1 to 100** (previously 1 to 20) to adjust difficulty  
7. The starting score is now **10** instead of 20  
8. A warning message appears for out-of-range inputs  
9. Clicking **Again** resets all variables and shows the **Check** button again
